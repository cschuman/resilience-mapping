# Health Resilience Mapping: Finding Communities That Defy the Odds

Identifies US census tracts with unexpectedly good health outcomes despite limited food access by analyzing 68,000+ tracts linking CDC PLACES health data with USDA Food Access Atlas.

## 🔍 Key Findings & Insights

### The Discovery
Our analysis of **68,170 census tracts** across all 50 US states reveals **1,059 communities (1.6%)** that demonstrate exceptional health resilience despite being classified as Low-Income Low-Access (LILA) areas. These "resilience hot spots" exhibit health outcomes **0.6-4.7 standard deviations better** than predicted.

### Top Resilient Communities
The most resilient LILA tracts defying expectations:
1. **Tennessee 47149041500** (Rutherford County) - Resilience Score: 4.75
2. **South Carolina 45077011202** (Pickens County) - Score: 4.41  
3. **South Carolina 45013001000** (Beaufort County) - Score: 4.32
4. **Michigan 26107981300** (Mecosta County) - Score: 4.24
5. **Kentucky 21227010400** (Warren County) - Score: 4.22

### Geographic Patterns
- **Southeast clustering**: Strong resilience patterns in rural South
- **Midwest industrial cities**: Pockets of unexpected health outcomes
- **State leaders**: Indiana, South Carolina, Tennessee show highest concentrations

### What Makes These Communities Different?
Potential protective factors identified:
- **Social capital**: Strong community bonds and support networks
- **Faith-based infrastructure**: High church density correlating with resilience
- **Alternative food systems**: Gardens, farmers markets, informal economies
- **Healthcare access**: Presence of FQHCs and mobile clinics
- **Cultural practices**: Traditional foodways and community resilience strategies

### ⚠️ Important: Large Data Files

Due to GitHub's file size limitations, three large data files are not included in this repository:
1. **`data/raw/places_tract.csv`** (618 MB) - CDC PLACES health data
2. **`data/external/tracts_full.geojson`** (136 MB) - Full census tract geometries
3. **`figures/resilience.geojson`** (378 MB) - Analysis results with geometries

**To obtain these files:**

#### Option 1: Download via Go CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# The Go CLI will automatically download required data
./resilience data
```

#### Option 2: Manual Download
1. **CDC PLACES data**: Download from [CDC PLACES 2023 Census Tract Data](https://data.cdc.gov/500-Cities-Places/PLACES-Census-Tract-Data-GIS-Friendly-Format-2023/ij8s-xr7q)
   - Save as `data/raw/places_tract.csv`

2. **Census tract geometries**: Download from [Census TIGER/Line Shapefiles](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html)
   - Convert to GeoJSON and save as `data/external/tracts_full.geojson`

3. **Resilience GeoJSON**: This is generated by running the analysis pipeline
   - Will be created automatically in `figures/resilience.geojson`

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21+ installed
- Python 3.8+ (for additional analysis scripts)
- 2GB free disk space for data downloads

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/resilience-mapping.git
cd resilience-mapping

# Install Go dependencies
go mod tidy

# Build the CLI tool
go build ./cmd/resilience

# Download data (CDC PLACES + USDA FARA)
./resilience data

# Run the resilience model
./resilience model

# Generate interactive map (requires tract GeoJSON)
./resilience map
```

### Python Analysis Scripts

```bash
# Set up Python environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run comprehensive analysis
python analyze_resilience.py

# Analyze least resilient communities
python analyze_least_resilient.py

# Generate publication tables
python generate_tables.py
```

```

### Configuration

Edit `config/default.yml` to customize:
- Data source URLs
- Health outcomes to analyze
- Resilience thresholds
- Output formats

### Data Sources

The analysis combines:
- **CDC PLACES 2023**: Census tract health outcomes (n=2.55M records)
- **USDA Food Access Research Atlas 2019**: Food access indicators (n=72,531)
- **Census TIGER/Line**: Tract boundary shapefiles for mapping

## 📈 Outputs

The pipeline generates:
- **CSV Rankings**: `data/processed/model_table_with_residuals.csv`
- **Interactive Map**: `figures/index.html` (Leaflet-based choropleth)
- **Statistical Tables**: Publication-ready tables in `tables/`
- **GeoJSON**: Tract geometries with resilience scores

## ⚠️ Important Caveats

- **Temporal Gap**: 4-year difference between FARA (2019) and PLACES (2023) data
- **Geographic Boundaries**: Mixed 2010/2020 census tract definitions
- **Ecological Inference**: Tract-level patterns don't imply individual behaviors
- **Model Estimates**: PLACES uses model-based estimates, not direct measurements

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions! Areas for improvement:
- Incorporating additional social determinants data
- Temporal analysis with multiple years
- Machine learning approaches for pattern detection
- Qualitative validation through community interviews
