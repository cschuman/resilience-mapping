## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL PATTERN DISCOVERED

**7 out of 10 "most resilient food deserts" are college towns or military bases!**

This suggests the findings may be artifacts of:
1. **Young, healthy student populations** temporarily residing in tracts
2. **University dining halls** not counted as food retail
3. **Military commissaries** not included in supermarket counts
4. **Transient populations** that don't reflect permanent residents

## Where to Find 2023 Food Access Data

### Official Sources (Limited Updates)

1. **USDA Food Access Research Atlas**
   - Latest version: Still 2019 (as of January 2025)
   - URL: https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/
   - **Problem:** USDA hasn't released 2023 update yet

2. **USDA Food Environment Atlas**
   - Some 2022 data available
   - URL: https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-environment-atlas/
   - Limited tract-level detail

3. **CDC PLACES**
   - Has 2023 health data but NO food access measures
   - They removed food environment variables

### Alternative 2023 Data Sources

4. **Private Sector Data** (Would need to purchase/request)
   - **Nielsen TDLinx** - Commercial database of all food retailers
   - **InfoUSA/Data Axle** - Business listings including grocery
   - **SafeGraph** - Foot traffic data showing where people actually shop
   - **Google Places API** - Current grocery store locations

5. **Crowdsourced/Tech Options**
   - **OpenStreetMap** - Community-mapped grocery stores
   - **Yelp/Google Reviews** - API access to current businesses
   - **SNAP Retailer Database** - Updated quarterly by USDA
   - **WIC Vendor Lists** - State-by-state current vendors

6. **Academic Alternatives**
   - **National Establishment Time Series (NETS)** - Through universities
   - **Reference USA** - Library database access
   - **County Health Rankings** - Some 2022-2023 food data

### Recommended Approach for Verification

```python
# Quick verification strategy
1. Use SNAP Retailer Database (free, current)
2. Cross-reference with Google Places API
3. Compare to 2019 FARA baseline
4. Document changes in each "resilient" tract
```

### The Reality Check

Given that most "resilient" communities are **college towns or military bases**, we likely don't have a resilience story at all. We have a data artifact story about:
- How federal datasets miss special populations
- Why university/military areas appear as "food deserts"
- The danger of ecological inference

**New story angle:** "How Bad Data Could Misdirect Millions in Food Security Funding"

## Next Steps

1. **Verify university/military presence** in all top 100 resilient tracts
2. **Exclude special population tracts** and re-run analysis
3. **Check SNAP retailer database** for current food access
4. **Ground-truth top non-university/military tracts** if any remain

The Murfreesboro tract being #1 is the smoking gun - MTSU has 21,000 students eating in dining halls, living in a tract marked as a "food desert." This isn't resilience; it's a measurement problem.
