# New York Times Editor Requirements Checklist

## üî¥ CRITICAL GAPS THAT WOULD PREVENT PUBLICATION

### 1. **Verification of "Resilient" Communities**
- **Need**: On-the-ground reporting in 3-5 top "resilient" census tracts
- **Why**: Claims of exceptional health in food deserts require ground-truthing
- **Specific asks**:
  - Are there actually limited grocery stores, or is the 2019 data outdated?
  - Visit Tennessee tract 47149041500 - what's really there?
  - Interview residents - do they perceive themselves as healthy?
  - Check for special populations (retirement communities, colleges, military bases)

### 2. **COVID-19 Impact Documentation**
- **The elephant in the room**: 4-year gap spans the pandemic
- **Need**: 
  - How many supermarkets closed/opened 2019-2023?
  - Population migration data for these tracts
  - Food delivery service expansion in these areas
  - Acknowledgment of how pandemic changed everything
- **Why we can't ignore**: "Resilient" tracts in 2023 may simply be gentrified areas post-COVID

### 3. **Author Credentials & Conflicts**
- **Need full disclosure**:
  - Corey Schuman's institutional affiliation
  - Academic credentials and expertise area
  - Previous publications
  - Any connections to food industry, agriculture lobby, or policy organizations
  - Funding sources (even if "none" - why? Personal project? Coursework?)
- **Peer review status**: Has this been accepted at a journal? Under review? Preprint?

### 4. **Methodological Red Flags**

#### Census Tract Boundary Mismatch
- **Fatal flaw?**: FARA uses 2010 boundaries, PLACES uses 2020
- **Need**: 
  - Exact percentage of mismatched tracts
  - Sensitivity analysis excluding problematic tracts
  - Expert quote on whether this invalidates findings

#### Model-Based Estimates
- **Problem**: PLACES data aren't real measurements
- **Need**: 
  - Validation against actual health surveys in sample tracts
  - Confidence intervals for "resilient" classification
  - What if the "exceptional health" is just modeling error?

### 5. **Independent Expert Validation**
- **Minimum 3 external experts needed**:
  1. Food security researcher (prefer someone who's published on FARA limitations)
  2. Spatial epidemiologist (to assess ecological fallacy concerns)
  3. Community health practitioner (from one of these "resilient" areas)
- **Key questions for experts**:
  - Is the methodology sound?
  - Are alternative explanations more likely?
  - Policy implications appropriate?

## üü° IMPORTANT CONTEXT NEEDED

### 6. **Demographic Deep Dive**
- **Race/ethnicity composition** of resilient vs. non-resilient LILA tracts
- **Immigration patterns** - are these ethnic enclaves with different food systems?
- **Age distributions** - young populations? Aging out?
- **Education levels** - hidden college towns?

### 7. **Alternative Explanations to Investigate**

#### Data Quality Issues
- Are "resilient" tracts actually just measurement errors?
- Healthcare access differences affecting diagnosis rates?
- Population turnover since 2019?

#### Special Circumstances
- Military bases (commissaries not counted as supermarkets)
- University areas (dining halls, different demographics)
- Religious communities (Amish, Mennonite) with different food systems
- Tribal lands with sovereignty issues affecting data

### 8. **Historical Context**
- Were these areas food deserts in 2019 but not historically?
- Recent policy interventions (did any states/cities target these areas?)
- Connection to redlining, white flight, or gentrification patterns

### 9. **Corporate/Industry Angle**
- Dollar stores vs. supermarkets (FARA doesn't count dollar stores)
- Food delivery companies' expansion (DoorDash, Instacart penetration)
- Amazon Fresh, Walmart+ presence in these areas
- Corporate social responsibility programs targeting these tracts

## üü¢ STORY ENHANCEMENT NEEDS

### 10. **Human Stories**
- **Profiles of 2-3 families** in resilient tracts
  - How do they actually get food?
  - What does a week of meals look like?
  - Health challenges they face
- **Community leaders**: Who's making it work? Churches? Nonprofits?
- **Contrast family** in non-resilient LILA tract

### 11. **Visual Requirements**
- **Maps**: 
  - Interactive map with zoom to tract level
  - Before/after showing food landscape changes
- **Photos**: 
  - The Tennessee "super-resilient" tract
  - Where residents actually shop
  - Community resources (gardens, food pantries)
- **Infographic**: How the analysis worked (simple, clear)

### 12. **Policy Stakes**
- **Federal programs at risk**: Which initiatives might be cut based on this?
- **State legislation pending**: Any states considering policy changes?
- **2024 Farm Bill implications**: How might this influence debate?
- **Campaign issue**: Any politicians already citing similar data?

## üìä FACT-CHECKING REQUIREMENTS

### 13. **Numbers Verification**
- Random sample of 20 tracts - manually verify:
  - PLACES health data matches source
  - FARA classification correct
  - Geographic boundaries properly matched
- Rerun analysis with different software/analyst
- Check top 10 resilient tracts for data entry errors

### 14. **Geographic Verification**
- Google Street View of top 20 resilient tracts
- Confirm rural/urban classification
- Verify no new supermarkets since 2019

### 15. **Statistical Review**
- Independent statistician to verify:
  - Appropriate use of OLS regression
  - State fixed effects properly implemented
  - Residuals actually indicate "resilience" vs. model misspecification
  - Multiple testing corrections needed?

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

### 16. **Harm Assessment**
- **Who could be hurt** if this story runs?
  - Communities losing food assistance
  - Justification for cutting SNAP benefits
  - "Bootstrap" narrative weaponization
- **Mitigation**: How prominently feature warnings against disinvestment?

### 17. **Community Consent**
- Have residents of "resilient" tracts been informed?
- Do they want this attention?
- Risk of gentrification acceleration?

## üìù FINAL DOCUMENTATION NEEDED

### 18. **Complete Package**
1. Full dataset with documentation
2. Analysis code that reporters can run
3. List of every assumption and limitation
4. Contact info for 5+ residents in top resilient tracts
5. Government officials' responses (USDA, CDC)
6. Rebuttal to likely criticisms

### 19. **Competitive Landscape**
- Who else has this story?
- Embargo terms?
- Exclusive access to data/communities?

### 20. **Follow-Up Potential**
- Can reporter spend a week in top resilient community?
- Access to longitudinal data for trend story?
- Connection to broader series on American resilience?

## BOTTOM LINE EDITORIAL DECISION FACTORS

**TO GREENLIGHT, WE NEED:**
1. ‚úÖ Ground-truthing in at least 3 "resilient" communities
2. ‚úÖ Resolution of the 2010/2020 boundary issue
3. ‚úÖ COVID impact acknowledgment and analysis
4. ‚úÖ Three independent experts endorsing methodology
5. ‚úÖ Human stories from resilient communities
6. ‚úÖ Clear evidence this isn't just gentrification or data artifacts

**BIGGEST CONCERNS:**
- üö® Temporal gap makes findings potentially obsolete
- üö® Risk of harmful policy narrative
- üö® Ecological fallacy problems
- üö® No peer review yet

**SUGGESTED APPROACH:**
Rather than straight news, consider:
- **Methodological investigation**: "What happens when you data-mine federal databases?"
- **Feature on one community**: Deep dive on most resilient tract
- **Part of series**: "The Limits of Big Data in Public Health"
- **Opinion piece**: If author has credentials, with heavy caveats

**HEADLINE TESTS:**
- ‚ùå "1,000 Food Deserts Thrive Despite Limited Access" (too simplistic)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "Study Finds Surprising Health in Food Deserts" (needs caveats)
- ‚úÖ "The Mystery of America's Healthiest Food Deserts" (investigation frame)
- ‚úÖ "What One Tennessee Community Reveals About Flawed Food Desert Data" (specific, skeptical)

*Editor's Note: This story has potential but needs substantial additional reporting. The gap between 2019 food data and 2023 health data is nearly fatal to newsworthiness. Recommend either killing or assigning 2-3 weeks of ground reporting to verify claims.*
