## 📊 Key Statistics for Paper

### Sample Size
- 68,170 census tracts analyzed (94% of US)
- 50 states represented
- 8,734 LILA tracts in main analysis

### Main Finding
- **1,059 LILA tracts (12.1%)** show high resilience (>90th percentile)
- Resilience scores range from -11.03 to 4.75
- Top resilient tract: Tennessee 47149041500 (score: 4.75)

### Model Performance
- R² = 0.421 (42% variance explained)
- RMSE = 0.551
- All key predictors significant at p<0.01

### Robustness
- 78% of resilience classifications stable across LILA thresholds
- Minimal spatial autocorrelation (0.0023)
- Consistent effects across burden distribution quantiles

## 🔄 Still Needed for Journal Submission

### Administrative
- [ ] Author information and affiliations
- [ ] Corresponding author designation
- [ ] Author contribution statements
- [ ] Funding statement (note: no external funding)
- [ ] IRB exemption documentation
- [ ] Data availability statement with repository URL
- [ ] Conflict of interest declarations

### Technical Improvements
- [ ] Full Moran's I with actual tract centroids
- [ ] Crosswalk documentation for 2010/2020 tract boundaries
- [ ] Power analysis for sample size justification
- [ ] Multiple testing correction for state comparisons

### Journal-Specific Requirements
- [ ] Format according to target journal guidelines
- [ ] Word count compliance (typically 3,500-5,000)
- [ ] Structured abstract if required
- [ ] Keywords expansion (5-8 typically required)
- [ ] STROBE checklist for observational studies

### Supplementary Files
- [ ] README for replication package
- [ ] Docker/container for reproducibility
- [ ] Full dataset with documentation
- [ ] Interactive visualization hosting

## 📝 Submission Ready Status: 85%

### Strengths
- Complete empirical analysis with robust findings
- Multiple sensitivity analyses confirm main results
- Clear policy implications with appropriate caveats
- Publication-quality tables in both CSV and LaTeX

### Remaining Gaps
- Administrative requirements (authors, affiliations)
- Journal-specific formatting
- Full spatial analysis with geographic data
- Hosted interactive visualizations

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Add author information and format for target journal
2. **Short-term**: Complete spatial analysis with tract centroids
3. **Before submission**: Set up replication package with DOI
4. **Optional enhancement**: Add ACS demographic data for richer analysis
