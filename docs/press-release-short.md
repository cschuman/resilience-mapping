**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

## Study Finds 1,000+ U.S. "Food Deserts" With Surprisingly Good Health Outcomes

**Researcher discovers communities "beating the odds" despite limited grocery access**

A new analysis of 68,000 U.S. census tracts reveals that 12% of areas classified as "food deserts"‚Äîlow-income communities with limited supermarket access‚Äîdemonstrate exceptional health outcomes that defy expectations.

Researcher Corey Schuman analyzed federal health and food access data to identify 1,059 communities where residents maintain lower rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease than statistical models predict, despite facing significant barriers to healthy food.

"These communities are doing something right that we need to understand," said Schuman. "While we absolutely must continue working to improve food access, these 'bright spots' may hold lessons for more effective public health interventions."

The resilient communities span 15 states, with concentrations in Tennessee, South Carolina, Michigan, and Indiana. One Tennessee census tract showed health outcomes nearly 5 standard deviations better than expected‚Äîamong the best in the nation despite limited food access.

**Potential protective factors include:**
- Strong social networks and community support
- Alternative food sources (gardens, informal markets)  
- Cultural practices and traditional foodways
- Local healthcare resources

Schuman cautions against using findings to justify reduced investment: "This isn't about celebrating communities for 'making do' with less‚Äîit's about learning from their strengths while still addressing structural inequities."

The research uses publicly available CDC and USDA data, demonstrating how federal datasets can reveal hidden public health patterns. Full results and interactive maps are available online.

üî¨ NEW RESEARCH: We analyzed 68,000 US census tracts and found something unexpected:

Over 1,000 "food desert" communities have BETTER health outcomes than predicted. 

What's their secret? üßµ

**Tweet 2:**  
Despite limited supermarket access, 12% of low-income food deserts show remarkably low rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.

These aren't wealthy areas‚Äîthey face the same economic challenges as other food deserts.

**Tweet 3:**  
Top resilient communities found in:
üìç Tennessee  
üìç South Carolina  
üìç Michigan  
üìç Indiana

One TN tract scored 4.75 standard deviations BETTER than expected‚Äîamong the nation's healthiest despite food access barriers.

**Tweet 4:**  
Possible protective factors:
‚Ä¢ Strong community bonds & resource sharing
‚Ä¢ Gardens & alternative food systems  
‚Ä¢ Cultural food traditions
‚Ä¢ Faith-based support networks
‚Ä¢ Local health clinics

**Tweet 5:**  
‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: This doesn't mean food deserts aren't a problem or that communities don't need investment.

It means some communities have developed remarkable resilience that we can learn from.

**Tweet 6:**  
The goal: Understand what helps these communities thrive so we can:
‚úÖ Support existing community strengths
‚úÖ Design better interventions
‚úÖ Avoid one-size-fits-all solutions

**New Research Reveals Hidden Resilience in America's Food Deserts**

I'm excited to share findings from my latest research analyzing 68,170 U.S. census tracts to understand health outcomes in food-insecure communities.

**The Surprising Discovery:** 12% of "food deserts"‚Äîlow-income areas with limited supermarket access‚Äîdemonstrate exceptional health outcomes, defying statistical predictions.

**Key Findings:**
‚Ä¢ 1,059 communities show health resilience despite food access barriers
‚Ä¢ These areas have obesity, diabetes, and heart disease rates comparable to or better than well-resourced neighborhoods  
‚Ä¢ Geographic clustering suggests regional protective factors at play

**Why This Matters:**
Rather than viewing all food-insecure communities through a deficit lens, this research identifies "bright spots" that can inform more effective, culturally-responsive public health interventions.

**Potential Protective Factors:**
- Social capital and community cohesion
- Alternative food systems (gardens, farmers markets)
- Cultural practices and traditional foodways
- Community-based healthcare resources

**Important Context:**
This research absolutely does not suggest food insecurity isn't a critical problem. Instead, it reveals heterogeneity within food-insecure communities and highlights the importance of understanding existing community assets.

**Methodology Highlights:**
- Used CDC PLACES 2023 and USDA Food Access Research Atlas
- Applied rigorous statistical controls and sensitivity analyses
- All data and code publicly available for transparency

**Next Steps:**
We need mixed-methods research to understand the stories behind these statistics. What strategies and resources enable these communities to maintain health despite structural disadvantages?

I welcome thoughts and collaboration opportunities from public health professionals, policymakers, and community organizations working on food security and health equity.

**Subject: Story Opportunity: Surprising Health Success in America's Food Deserts**

Dear [Reporter Name],

Given your excellent coverage of public health/food security issues, I wanted to share new research that challenges conventional narratives about food deserts.

**The Hook:** Over 1,000 U.S. "food desert" communities demonstrate exceptional health outcomes‚Äîbetter than many areas with abundant food access. What's their secret?

**Why Now:**
- USDA updating Food Access Atlas methodology
- Growing interest in asset-based community development
- Post-pandemic focus on community resilience

**Visual Elements:**
- Interactive maps of resilient communities
- Clear charts showing the surprising patterns
- Specific community examples (great for local angles)

**Expert Availability:**
I'm available for interviews and can provide:
- Plain-language explanations of findings
- Policy implications
- Specific state/local data
- Connection to broader health equity issues

The research uses only public federal data, demonstrating government transparency while revealing important public health patterns.

Would you be interested in discussing this story? I'm happy to provide an advance copy of the full paper and additional materials.

Best regards,
Corey Schuman
