## New Study Identifies Over 1,000 U.S. Communities "Beating the Odds" on Health Despite Limited Food Access

### Research challenges deficit-based narratives about food deserts, revealing surprising health resilience in 12% of food-insecure census tracts

**[CITY, State] – January 2025** – A groundbreaking analysis of 68,170 U.S. census tracts has identified 1,059 communities that demonstrate exceptional health outcomes despite being classified as "food deserts" with limited access to supermarkets. The research, conducted by Corey Schuman, challenges conventional narratives about food insecurity and suggests that some communities possess protective factors that help them maintain health despite structural disadvantages.

The study, which links CDC health data with USDA food access indicators, found that 12% of Low-Income, Low-Access (LILA) census tracts—areas where residents face both poverty and distance barriers to grocery stores—show health outcomes significantly better than predicted by statistical models. These "resilient" communities have obesity, diabetes, and heart disease rates comparable to or better than areas with abundant food access.

"While we must continue addressing food insecurity as a critical public health issue, this research reveals remarkable heterogeneity within food-insecure communities," said Schuman. "Understanding why some communities thrive despite limited food access could inform more effective, culturally responsive interventions."

## Key Findings

The research analyzed health outcomes for over 67,000 census tracts, representing 94% of the U.S. population, and found:

- **1,059 food-insecure communities demonstrate exceptional health resilience**, with outcomes 0.6 to 4.7 standard deviations better than expected
- **Geographic clustering** of resilient communities in the Southeast and Midwest suggests regional protective factors
- **High variance** in health outcomes within food deserts indicates diverse coping mechanisms and community resources

The top resilient communities span 15 states, with notable concentrations in Tennessee, South Carolina, Indiana, and Michigan. For example, a census tract in Rutherford County, Tennessee, despite limited supermarket access, shows health outcomes nearly 5 standard deviations better than predicted—among the best in the nation.

## Potential Protective Factors

While the study cannot definitively identify causal mechanisms, geographic patterns suggest several protective factors may be at play:

- **Social capital and community cohesion** that facilitate resource sharing
- **Alternative food systems** including gardens, farmers markets, and informal food networks
- **Cultural practices and traditional foodways** that promote health
- **Faith-based and community organizations** providing support beyond food access
- **Local healthcare infrastructure** including Federally Qualified Health Centers

## Methodology and Rigor

The research employed rigorous statistical methods, including:
- Ordinary least squares regression with state fixed effects
- Sensitivity analysis across multiple food access definitions
- Robustness checks using quantile regression
- Spatial autocorrelation tests

The analysis used publicly available data from the CDC PLACES initiative (2023) and USDA Food Access Research Atlas (2019), demonstrating how federal open data can reveal important public health patterns.

## Policy Implications with Critical Caveats

Schuman emphasizes that these findings must not be used to justify disinvestment from food-insecure communities. "The goal is not to celebrate communities for 'making do' with less, but to understand how some communities thrive despite constraints. This knowledge should complement, not replace, efforts to address structural inequities in food access."

The research suggests policymakers should:
- Investigate protective factors in resilient communities through community-engaged research
- Support existing community assets rather than imposing one-size-fits-all solutions
- Facilitate peer learning between communities
- Avoid narratives that blame communities for poor health outcomes

## Limitations and Next Steps

The study acknowledges several limitations, including a temporal gap between datasets that spans the COVID-19 pandemic and the ecological nature of tract-level analysis. Schuman calls for mixed-methods follow-up research that includes community voices and lived experiences.

"Statistical patterns are just the beginning," Schuman notes. "We need qualitative research in these resilient communities to understand the stories behind the numbers. What strategies, relationships, and resources enable these communities to maintain health despite food access challenges?"

## Broader Impact

This research contributes to a growing body of work on positive deviance—the study of individuals or communities that succeed despite facing the same constraints as their peers. By shifting focus from deficits to assets, the study opens new avenues for public health intervention.

The findings are particularly relevant as the USDA prepares to update its Food Access Research Atlas and as communities nationwide seek evidence-based strategies to address health disparities. The research also demonstrates the value of linking federal datasets to uncover hidden patterns in public health.

## About the Research

The full study, "Beating the Odds: Identifying Health Resilience in Food-Insecure Communities Using Federal Open Data," includes detailed methodology, sensitivity analyses, and interactive maps of resilient communities. All data and analysis code are publicly available to ensure reproducibility and transparency.

The research used no external funding and was conducted using publicly available federal data, demonstrating the potential for impactful public health research using open government resources.
